# 0.7.1

### Bug Fixes

* Added better support for scheduling failure handling
* Fixed RetryPolicy failure assignability checking

* Invocation APIs were renamed to Execution to better align with the `java.util.concurrent` naming.
* `InvocationStats.getAttemptCount()` was renamed to `ExecutionStats.getExecutions()`

# 0.7.0

# 0.6.0

### New Features

* Added `RetryPolicy.abortOn`, `abortWhen` and `abortIf` methods to abort retries when matched.

### API Changes

* `RetryPolicy.retryWhen` was renamed to `retryIf` for retrying if a `Predicate` is matched.
* `RetryPolicy.retryFor` was renamed to `retryWhen` for retrying when a result is matched.

# 0.5.0

### New Features

* Added support for synchronous and asynchronous event listeners
* Added support for `CheckedRunnable`

### API Changes

* The `Recurrent.run` methods now require a `CheckedRunnable` rather than `Runnable`. This allows Recurrent to be used on code that throws checked exceptions without having to wrap the code in try/catch blocks.
* The synchronous `Recurrent.run` and `Recurrent.get` methods will throw a `RecurrentException` if a failure occurs and the retry policy is exceeded.
